## Stone Model

$$
x(t+1) = x(t) + v \times dt + \sqrt(dt) \times s \times N(0,1)
$$
Where $x$ is the decision variable, $v$ is the drift rate, $dt$ is the step size, $s$ is the standard deviation of the noise, $N(0,1)$ denotes the normal distribution. The RTs for this model do not include any variability and just involve addition of a residual movement time $T_{er}$

## StoneEta

$$
x(t+1) = x(t) + v_{sample} \times dt + \sqrt(dt) \times s \times N(0,1)
$$

$$
v_{sample} \sim N(v, \eta)
$$
Where $v_{sample}$ is drawn from each trial from a normal distribution with mean $v$ and a standard deviation $\eta$. 

## StoneEtaVarTer

Is the same formulation as the stoneEta model except it also includes variability in the non decision time.
$$
x(t+1) = x(t) + v_{sample} \times dt + \sqrt(dt) \times s \times N(0,1)
$$

$$
v_{sample} \sim N(v, \eta)
$$
Conventionally, variability in the non decision time
