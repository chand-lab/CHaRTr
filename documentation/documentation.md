### Using this toolbox.

This toolbox is an attempt by us (Chand and Guy) to provide the legions
of researchers interested in various models of decision-making a simple
and easily used toolbox for analysis of RT and discrimination accuracy
behavior in decision-making tasks. The architecture of the toolbox is
very simple. The choosing of which model to run and the lower and upper
parameters and the

We assume that there is a reasonable working knowledge of R and C.

Stone Model
-----------

$$
x(t+1) = x(t) + v \\times dt + \\sqrt(dt) \\times s \\times N(0,1)
$$
 Where *x* is the decision variable, *v* is the drift rate, *d**t* is
the step size, *s* is the standard deviation of the noise, *N*(0,â€†1)
denotes the normal distribution
